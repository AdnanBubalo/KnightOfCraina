# Knight of Craina

Unity game developed with Edis (https://github.com/ediszatega).<br>
I did the work on the player, enemies, combat and audio.<br>
You play as a knight climbing a tower to save the princess on the top.<br>
On each level you fight enemies before progressing forward.<br>
Stronger enemies spawn each level.<br>
Defeating enemies grants coins that can be used in a shop to upgrade the knight.<br>
Items in the shop include:
- a health upgrade that heals you and upgrades your max health<br>
- a shield that shields you from damage<br>
- a damage upgrade<br>
- a speed upgrade<br>
- a fireball that allows you to shoot fireballs<br>
- an iceball that allows you to shoot iceballs<br>

I plan on polishing the combat, adding more enemies, a final boss and other things that I think off.
