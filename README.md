# Knight of Craina

Unity game made with Edis(https://github.com/ediszatega).
I did the work on the player, enemies, combat and audio.
You play as a knight climbing a tower to save the princess on the top.
On each level you fight enemies before progressing forward.
Stronger enemies spawn each level.
Defeating enemies grants coins that can be used in a shop to upgrade the knight.
Items in the shop include: - a health upgrade that heals you and upgrades your max health
                           - a shield that shields you from damage
                           - a damage upgrade
                           - a speed upgrade
                           - a fireball that allows you to shoot fireballs
                           - an iceball that allows you to shoot iceballs
